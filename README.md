## My Wallet - Angular Application

### Overview

"My Wallet" is an Angular-based web application designed to help users manage their finances by categorizing expenses and calculating total amounts. The application provides an interactive interface where users can input their total amount, divide it into different categories (Needs, Wants, Savings), and track their spending and savings. The app is structured with multiple reusable components, making it modular and easy to maintain. This app uses the golden rule of 50%, 30%, and 20% income redistribution.
